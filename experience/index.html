		<h3>2020 | sabbatical leave</h3>

<p>Wanted to modernize and extend my open source software stack, implementing some microservices along the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/id/razvhost">razvhost</a>:
a reverse proxy with many features, similar to Caddy</li>
<li><a href="/projects/id/razbox">razbox</a> and <a href="/projects/id/beepboop">beepboop</a>:
a lightweight and easy to launch file hosting service and the library that powers it</li>

		<h3>2020 | VCC Live | backend developer</h3>

<p>Worked on a reference implementation of microservice feature flags and benchmarked the memory management of our software telecom switch.
Left due to lack of exposure to Golang projects.</p>

	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h3>2019 | sabbatical leave | <a href="/projects/id/poccemod">PocceMod</a></h3>

<p>Created the first GTA5 (FiveM) game mod that allowed players to have fun with GTA&rsquo;s unused and undocumented rope API in a multiplayer environment.
After sharing it with the community early on to receive feedback, the mod went through 2 months of intensive development, adding many of the requested features and changes.
The project quickly gained popularity due to its uniqueness and led to community members requesting my services.</p>

<p>This period also marked the beginning of my pursuit of Golang development, leading to one of my first public projects:
<a href="/projects/id/riddle_solver">Riddle Solver</a></p>

		<h3>2017 - 2019 | Ericsson | senior software developer</h3>

<p>Worked on the packet functions of a microwave network device family.
Was an unofficial C++ expert in a 10-person team.
Implemented a network protocol together with a teammate based on an RFC document and released weeks before the deadline.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>2017 | sabbatical leave | <a href="/projects/id/potato_game">Potato Game</a></h3>

<p>Wanted to try something out of the box and build a tech demo of a completely procedurally generated abstract looking 3D game world.
During the development I&rsquo;ve been a part of a coach guided mastermind program, where participants could follow the progress of graphical designs
and world map and level generator algorithms.
At the end of the mastermind program I had the chance to publicly talk about the project in front of an audience,
where one person told me I inspired him to learn programming. This has been one of my proudest moments in life.</p>

		<h3>2014 | sabbatical leave | <a href="/projects/id/prepi">Prepi</a></h3>

<p>Worked on an indie rage game project as part of a two-person team, focusing on game engine development.
It has been a serious project requiring both of our full-time commitment.
Having zero clue about sales and with the mindset of &ldquo;great products sell themselves&rdquo; we tried to finance the project via an Indiegogo campaign,
which failed (though the game received Steam GreenLight later).
Due to the failure of the campaign and smaller disagreements regarding the game design we decided not to continue the development.</p>

<p>Worked on a flagship router product in a 3-person team.

Developed an extension protocol based on RFC document.
Spent 5 weeks in Beijing to transfer knowledge to the local team.</p>
