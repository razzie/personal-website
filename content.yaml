hello: |
  My name is **Gábor Görzsöny**, but you might also know me as **Razzie** from my online presence.
  With a strong foundation in software engineering,
  I bring over 7 years of formal experience across multiple sectors and programming languages, which doubles when including hobby projects.
  I am confident that I can deliver valuable solutions for you, your business partners and customers.

  My career began with a fascination for video games, which spurred me to self-learn coding from a young age.
  This journey has evolved significantly, steering me towards learning industry-standard techniques and cutting-edge technologies.

  In addition to my professional work, I am an avid hobbyist developer.
  I enjoy working on open-source projects, many of which are self-hosted.
  My recent ventures include developing a cloud platform and a range of Go-based software tools.
  
  I am deeply passionate about continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
  My friends and colleagues know me as someone who thrives on engaging in philosophical and technical discussions.
  Creativity and curiosity are the cornerstones of my work ethic, driving me to explore and innovate constantly.
  
  In my opinion, the greatest achievements in human history have resulted from collaborative efforts spearheaded by visionary leaders.
  My aspiration is to become one of these key individuals.
  
  I am currently open to full remote positions, with a strong preference for roles focused on Golang and cloud development.
  If my [skills](/skills) and [experiences](/experience) align with your needs, please feel free to reach out to me via email at <span id="email"></span>.
  I look forward to potential collaborations that challenge and inspire me.

experience:
- |-
  ### 2023+ | sabbatical leave

  Had a long mental list of projects I could attend to, including an [online chess game](/projects/id/razchess)
  and many tools and libraries I now rely on:
  - [mock](/projects/id/mock):
    testify mock without the boilerplate
  - [broadcaster](/projects/id/broadcaster):
    add zero, one or many more listeners to an event source
  - [razcache](/projects/id/razcache):
    abstraction layer over Redis, Badger and an in-memory store (similar to kvgo but with expirations)
  - [botkit](/projects/id/botkit) and [commander](/projects/id/commander):
    libraries to build Telegram chatbots
  - [json2go](/projects/id/json2go):
    map third-party JSON APIs to Go structs

  Currently working on a custom cloud platform for personal use.

  ### 2021 - 2022 | Cloudera | senior software engineer

  Took part in a proof-of-concept project, implementing data ingestion for the main workload app and later working on tenant signup and resource pooling.
  Earned **Commitment Award** for prioritizing and achieving data driven results.<br>
  Later worked with one of the international data warehouse teams and got my hands dirty with the CI pipeline as well.

- |-
  ### 2020 | sabbatical leave

  Wanted to modernize and extend my open source software stack, implementing some microservices along the way:
  - [razvhost](/projects/id/razvhost):
    a reverse proxy with many features, similar to Caddy
  - [razbox](/projects/id/razbox) and [beepboop](/projects/id/beepboop):
    a lightweight and easy to launch file hosting service and the library that powers it
  - [razproxy](/projects/id/razproxy):
    my own VPN alternative, but way less resource hungry
  - [geoip-server](/projects/id/geoip) and [mediaserver](/projects/id/mediaserver):
    just some lightweight microservices implemented for fun

- |-
  ### 2020 | VCC Live | backend developer

  Worked on a reference implementation of microservice feature flags and benchmarked the memory management of our software telecom switch.
  Left due to lack of exposure to Golang projects.

- |-
  ### 2019 | sabbatical leave | [PocceMod](/projects/id/poccemod)

  Created the first GTA5 (FiveM) game mod that allowed players to have fun with GTA's unused and undocumented rope API in a multiplayer environment.
  After sharing it with the community early on to receive feedback, the mod went through 2 months of intensive development, adding many of the requested features and changes.
  The project quickly gained popularity due to its uniqueness and led to community members requesting my services.

  This period also marked the beginning of my pursuit of Golang development, leading to one of my first public projects:
  [Riddle Solver](/projects/id/riddle_solver)

- |-
  ### 2017 - 2019 | Ericsson | senior software developer

  Worked on the packet functions of a microwave network device family.
  Was an unofficial C++ expert in a 10-person team.
  Implemented a network protocol together with a teammate based on an RFC document and released weeks before the deadline.

- |-
  ### 2017 | sabbatical leave | [Potato Game](/projects/id/potato_game)

  Wanted to try something out of the box and build a tech demo of a completely procedurally generated abstract looking 3D game world.
  During the development I've been a part of a coach guided mastermind program, where participants could follow the progress of graphical designs
  and world map and level generator algorithms.
  At the end of the mastermind program I had the chance to publicly talk about the project in front of an audience,
  where one person told me I inspired him to learn programming. This has been one of my proudest moments in life.

- |-
  ### 2015 - 2016 | Cognex | software engineer

  Participated in multiple mainly GUI related projects while working together with the firmware team to resolve compatibility issues.
  Took part in greenfield web backend development and database design, while also working on internal tools and experiments to assist my team.

- |-
  ### 2014 | sabbatical leave | [Prepi](/projects/id/prepi)

  Worked on an indie rage game project as part of a two-person team, focusing on game engine development.
  It has been a serious project requiring both of our full-time commitment.
  Having zero clue about sales and with the mindset of "great products sell themselves" we tried to finance the project via an Indiegogo campaign,
  which failed (though the game received Steam GreenLight later).
  Due to the failure of the campaign and smaller disagreements regarding the game design we decided not to continue the development.

- |-
  ### 2012 - 2014 | Ericsson | software developer

  Worked on a flagship router product in a 3-person team.
  Was responsible for the network management interface which was highly interconnected with all internal modules.
  Developed an extension protocol based on RFC document.
  Spent 5 weeks in Beijing to transfer knowledge to the local team.

- |-
  ### 2008 - 2012 | University of Debrecen | student

  Completed a 7-semester standard curriculum in Computer Science and Engineering without any course retakes,
  earning a Bachelor's Degree with good qualifications and a specialization in Info-Communication Networks.
