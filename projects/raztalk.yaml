  A simple lobby/channel based registration-free webchat.
  Implemented using NancyFX and SignalR packages and support dynamic loading of bot libraries during runtime.
  The repo contains (outdated) bot implementations for CleverBot, Giphy, Imgur and Reddit.
  There is also a standalone desktop client, which is just a wrapper around the web interface.
