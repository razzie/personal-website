  Floating Islands is yet another example of my experiments with procedurally generated terrains.
  I developed an algorithm that takes island positions and island connections as input parameters and generates a 3D grid world using a Perlin noise internally.
  I focused on the cartoonish design with edge outlining and also had an A* pathfinder algorithm set up for the little red cube.
