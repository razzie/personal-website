  A simple Kubernetes stack that hosted many of my own projects plus an email service (Dovecot + Postfix) and Nextcloud.
  The goal of this project was simplified deployment and cost saving, without horizontal autoscaling, though I picked K8s to be able to scale in the future.
  Many of the hosted webapps used a shared Redis (Kvrocks) instance with separate namespaces, thanks to [k8s-db-operator](/projects/id/k8s-db-operator).
  Deployment was done via Helmfile and Helm under the hood, but it was managed by a Makefile to make things even simpler.
