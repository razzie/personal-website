  * ###### 2015 version
    The site made use of user friendly URLs (thanks to Apache web server's mod_rewrite) and loaded pages dynamically via jQuery's AJAX API.
    A server side PHP script automatically parsed the static HTML pages for sections, which could then be accessed individually by the user.
    It wasn't very CPU friendly, but made it easy for me to add new content to the page without using a database.
    Later my Twitter feed was integrated as a news feed, using OAuth and Twitter's API.

  * ###### 2018 version
    Implemented in C# using NancyFX and a brand new design.
    It used Github API to list my latest open-source interests and contributions.
    Project data was stored in XML.

  * ###### 2019 version
    Everything completely rewritten in Go.
    Data was still stored in XML files initially, but later all the content (including resume) was moved to
    a single yaml file, which was periodically updated directly from the repository.

  * ###### 2024 version
    Completely rewritten everythign again, using Go + PicoCSS + HTMX stack.
    It supports light and dark themes (based on user preferences reported by the browser) and features HTMX
    boosted page loads and loading spinner.
    Project data is stored in individual yaml files, everything else is in HTML templates.
    It does not rely on third party feeds anymore.
