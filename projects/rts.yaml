  This was my very first coded game (after finishing some games in an early version of GameMaker).
  I've created all the graphics in Microsoft Paint, so the game looks terrible.
  The goal is to destroy the enemy's base.
  The player needs to collect resources (money and energy) to deploy buildings and produce units (soldiers, tanks, citizens, etc).
  Energy can be harvested by building windmills, while money can be gathered by mining.
  The enemy's AI is very basic: its units are moving randomly and once they notice a player building or unit, they just attack it.
  They also deploy new buildings randomly once they have enough resources.
  Due to the lack of timing, the more units appeared in the game, the slower they became.
