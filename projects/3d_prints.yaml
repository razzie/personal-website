  I've been fascinated by magnets even since I was a kid, but it only turned into experimentation
  when I came across a video about Halbach arrays.
  I wondered whether I could come up with an unassisted levitation design, so I got myself an FLSUN Q5 delta 3D printer,
  a few dozens of magnetic cubes and learned how to create models in TinkerCad.
  Even though I did not succeed in my initial plan, I still ended up with some fun magnetic toys I can show my guests
  and a bunch of rock-paper-scissors dices for boardgames.
