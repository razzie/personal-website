  Super simple cloud file storage with almost zero configuration - powered by [Beepboop](/projects/id/beepboop)
  Razbox stores all configuration and metadata in JSON files on the local filesystem and doesn't rely on a relational database
  (though it has opt-in support for Redis caching).
  Each folder can contain a *.razbox* file (which can be generated by included tools) and the content is ready to be served.
  Read and write access to these folders can rely on separate passwords, so you can share read access only if you want.
  Subfolders are also supported and they inherit the read/write passwords, unless a *.razbox* file is generated for them.
  Uploaded files can have an arbitrary number of tags that allow filtering.
  Thumbnails are generated for media files (using ffmpeg for videos!), which are visible in gallery view.
  Some archive formats are also supported for read-only browsing.
  Individual files can be shared publicly, this making them readable without any password.
