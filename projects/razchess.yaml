  I've had a sudden spark of interest in chess as of late 2022 and decided to build my own web chess app with focus on simplicity and ease of use.
  Also I didn't want to waste time convincing friends to register to [insert your favorite chess platform here]. With RazChess you just visit the website,
  copy the link of the session and pass it to the person you want to play with.
  As weeks passed I kept adding new features like chess puzzles (mate in two steps), Fischer random (chess960) game, included chess openings encyclopedia,
  custom games and the ability to download your matches as GIFs. There is also Redis support to restore active games after a restart.
