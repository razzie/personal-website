  RazzGravitas is a simple multiplayer game about gravity.
  At the time of making it I just gave up on a somewhat larger project and I needed to give myself a smaller task that I can prove to be able to finish.
  The sole objective was to experiment with something simple with no regrets about design decisions and no promises about the outcome.
  After about a month of development it ended up having multiplayer support with competitive game rules I'm satisfied with.
  I consider the game finished.
