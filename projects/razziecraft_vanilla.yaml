  RazzieCraft Vanilla is Minecraft version 1.12.2 on steroids!
  This pack contains a ton of strictly curated mods that enhance the visuals and gameplay of vanilla Minecraft,
  but without breaking its charm. There are a lot of recipes for uncraftable existing items (like chain armor, slime ball, spawn
  eggs, etc) and a very few brand new stuff.
