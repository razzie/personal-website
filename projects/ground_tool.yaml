description: |-
  The idea behind the demo was a game with floating islands.
  Though this game never made it to the reality, Ground Tool was born as a result of experimenting with the rendering of these islands.
  The user can draw a polygon border to the island and when all points are connected, the program generates an island which can be inspected by zooming and moving the camera around.
