  PotatoGame was meant to be a game about little potatoes with customizable AI gaining world domination,
  though my real motivation was to make art.
  I wanted to try something out of the box and build a tech demo of a completely procedurally generated abstract looking 3D game world.
  During the development I've been a part of a coach guided mastermind program, where participants could follow the progress of graphical designs
  and world map and level generator algorithms.
  At the end of the mastermind program I had the chance to publicly talk about the project in front of an audience,
  where one person told me I inspired him to learn programming. This has been one of my proudest moments in life.
