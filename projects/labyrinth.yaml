  Labyrinth is a small university project I developed together with a friend.
  It features random labyrinth generation with size, multi-level options.
  The user could select the wall and floor texturess or the optional bush wall (instead of the rock one).
  I have done the rendering part (using Irrlicht 3D engine) while my friend worked on the random generator algorithm and the bush modeling.
