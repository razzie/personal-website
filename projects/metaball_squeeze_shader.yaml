  This is not my first time experimenting with signed distance field (SDF) functions,
  and with this mini project I wanted to see if I could implement a sort-of soft body physics simulation with metaballs.
  The resulting squeeze effect is fun to watch and play with,
  though the metaballs/blobs don't retain their volume in case of collision.
  It took me a few weeks of sporadic work and some complete rewrites, and now I consider it ready for consumption.
