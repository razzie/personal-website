  I'm fascinated by procedural generated shapes and occasionally doodle using pen and paper to test ideas.
  This time my plan was to combine curvy vines and abstract looking rocks in a 2D sidescrolling game,
  with a shape shifting blob being controlled by the player. After many days of running this idea in my subconscious,
  I still lacked the imagination to come up with a design that fits my liking, and decided to test the new image
  generator capabilities of the ChatGPT 4o model (and other AI tools).
  After a long iterative process spanning a few days, I ended up with concept art images that felt surprisingly close
  to what I intended to achieve.
  The reason the game is stuck in the concept art phase is because I came up with better game/demo ideas that are
  not compatible with this design.
