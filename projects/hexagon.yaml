  I wanted to try rendering hexagon blocks (hexagonal prisms to be correct) instead of cubes.
  The underlying datastructure is a 3D grid procedurally generated by Perlin noise.
  This demo does not use textures, but has a custom GLSL shader that draws grass or rock details based on the normal vectors.
