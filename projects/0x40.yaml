  I've come across Kepstin's amazing [0x40hues](https://github.com/kepstin/0x40hues-html5) project and caught myself listening to it a lot.
  After finding community resource packs to try, it quickly became troublesome to configure and run them.
  This motivated me to fork the project and after a great deal of refactoring, it now supports loading many respacks and on-the-fly configuration.
