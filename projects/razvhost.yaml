description: |-
  Virtual hosting/reverse proxy with TLS termination and automatic certificate management.
  It supports proxying, file/directory serving, redirection, accessing SFTP or S3 buckets, hosting PHP projects or even tailing log files.
  The configuration is loaded from a single file that contains simple ```hostname -> target``` rules,
  where even templates are supported (check readme in repo).
  Changes to the config files are detected and applied during runtime.
  It can even watch Docker containers with VIRTUAL_HOST and VIRTUAL_PORT environment variables and direct traffic to them
  (though it would've been better to check labels instead, but it didn't cross my mind at the time).
