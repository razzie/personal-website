  A webapp that helps you write Go client libraries for JSON web APIs.
  One of my experiments required building a database that included data from many third party JSON web APIs.
  The process of deserializing data into manually crafted Go structs quickly got exhausting,
  so I had to come up with a solution. Json2Go is by no means perfect (it only looks at the fields of the first item of a JSON array),
  but it gets the job done.
  You can input a JSON or a URL that returns a JSON.
  Field names are automatically converted into camel case, stripped of unsupported characters
  and correctly annotated with the original name.
  The resulting generated structure is formatted and uses syntax highlighting.
