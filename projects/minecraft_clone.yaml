  Minecraft clone is a graphics project I worked on during the final year of the university.
  Contrary to its name it is not a real clone, it features no game elements aside from placing and removing blocks.
  My primary motivation was the recreation of a Minecraft-like rendering in C++,
  focusing on optimizations like omitting hidden block sides and dynamic loading of chunks/zones.
