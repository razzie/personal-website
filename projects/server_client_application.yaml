  Server - client application is a small tool which helps creating and debugging text based network protocols.
  I developed it while working on [Razzie Messenger](/projects/id/razzie_messenger) and it had a great use.
  On the server tab the user can select one of the connected clients as a message target or just close the connection to them.
