  Created the first GTA5 (FiveM) game mod that allowed players to have fun with GTA's unused and undocumented rope API in a multiplayer environment.
  After sharing it with the community early on to receive feedback, the project went through 2 months of intensive development, adding many of the requested features and changes.
  The project quickly gained popularity due to its uniqueness and led to community members requesting my services with other private mod projects.
