  Prepi is an indie rage game project I was working on together with a friend.
  It has been a serious project requiring both of our full-time commitment.
  Having zero clue about sales and with the mindset of "great products sell themselves" we tried to finance the project via an Indiegogo campaign,
  which failed (though the game received Steam GreenLight later).
  Due to the failure of the campaign and smaller disagreements regarding the game design we decided not to continue the development.
