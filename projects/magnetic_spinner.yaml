description: |-
  Spin one of the rings and the other one will spin with it if you arrange the magnets right.
  Though it didn't take considerable effort to design, it feels like a (useless) product and I like fidgeting with it,
  hence it received its own panel/description.
  The stand is removable to support modularity and potential future expansion.
  It was designed for 10x10x10mm magnet cubes, but consider scaling to 105% in your slicer before printing.
