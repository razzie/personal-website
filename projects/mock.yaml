  Mock generates a runtime [testify mock](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock) implementation for any Go interface
  without having to write any boilerplate (and in my opinion [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) counts as boilerplate too).
  It was one of a kind when first implemented, and possibly still is.
  The initial version used the goplus/reflectx package, but due to the linkname related limitations introduced in Go 1.23,
  I had to delve deep into the Go internals (ABI, GC, reflection) to be able to develop a standalone version.
  The only dependency is the testify package itself.
